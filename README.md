# IPL Data Analysis

Basically to replicate the same insights as [iplt20](https://www.iplt20.com/) using pandas. Downloaded ipl data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata)

## data:

Contains all the data files,

- **ipldata.zip** - deliveries and matches file
- **deliveries_formatted.csv** - team alias name formatted
- **matches_formatted.csv** - team, venue name formatted
- **deliveries_and_matches.csv** - matches and deliveries merged


**Note:**

*Few values are not exactly matching with the [iplt20.com](https://www.iplt20.com/stats/all-time) site results. Don't know how reliable the downloaded data or I missed subtlety logic. Sorry, cricket lovers. This repository is only to show few pandas function for analysis.*
